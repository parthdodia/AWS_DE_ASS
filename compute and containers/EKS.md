# 📘 Amazon EKS – Elastic Kubernetes Service

Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes clusters on AWS without managing the Kubernetes control plane.

---

## ✅ 1. Kubernetes Orchestration & Management

* Provides managed Kubernetes control plane with automatic upgrades, patching, and scaling  
* Supports running containerized applications using Kubernetes APIs  
* Integrates with AWS services for networking, security, and storage  

**📌 Exam Signal:**  
If the question involves Kubernetes cluster management or running Kubernetes workloads, EKS is the service.

---

## ✅ 2. Node Management & Compute Options

* Worker nodes run as EC2 instances or via AWS Fargate (serverless Kubernetes pods)  
* Supports Graviton2-based instances for cost-effective, high-performance workloads  
* Use managed node groups or self-managed nodes for flexibility  

**📌 Exam Signal:**  
If the question asks about Kubernetes worker nodes or serverless pods → EKS with EC2 nodes or Fargate pods.

---

## ✅ 3. Autoscaling & Cluster Management

* Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adjusts EC2 node count based on pod demand  
* Karpenter: Open-source, flexible, fast autoscaler that launches right-sized compute for pods dynamically  
* Supports scaling of Fargate profiles and node groups  

**📌 Exam Signal:**  
If the question involves dynamic provisioning of right-sized nodes or fast scaling → consider Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler.

---

## ✅ 4. Networking & Security

* Integrates with Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes pod networking (assigns pods ENIs with IPs)  
* Supports IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for fine-grained pod permissions  
* Supports network policies for pod-level network security  
* Runs within your VPC with security groups and private subnets  

**📌 Exam Signal:**  
Questions on secure Kubernetes pod permissions and networking → look for IRSA and VPC CNI.

---

## ✅ 5. Integration with AWS Services

* Works with Amazon ECR for container image storage  
* Integrates with CloudWatch Container Insights for monitoring Kubernetes clusters and pods  
* Supports AWS Load Balancers (ALB/NLB) for Kubernetes service load balancing  
* Can use AWS App Mesh for service mesh and microservice communication  

**📌 Exam Signal:**  
Look for Kubernetes-native integration with AWS monitoring and networking tools.

## ✅ 6. Use Cases

| Use Case                        | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running containerized microservices | Deploy Kubernetes workloads with high availability and scaling |
| Hybrid cloud Kubernetes deployments | Run consistent Kubernetes clusters across on-prem and AWS  |
| Serverless Kubernetes workloads | Use Fargate pods for serverless Kubernetes compute           |
| Complex networking & security   | Use Kubernetes network policies and IRSA for secure workloads|
| CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes | Deploy containerized apps with automated pipelines           |

**📌 Exam Signal:**  
Use EKS when Kubernetes standardization, control, and AWS integration are required.

## ✅ 7. EKS vs Alternatives

| Scenario / Need                | Use EKS                  | Use Alternative             |
| -----------------------------| ------------------------ | ---------------------------|
| Fully managed Kubernetes control plane | ✅ EKS                | Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2 |
| Serverless Kubernetes pods    | ✅ EKS Fargate pods       | ECS Fargate or Lambda       |
| Simple container orchestration | ❌ Complex Kubernetes overhead | ECS                     |
| Event-driven lightweight functions | ❌ Not ideal            | Lambda                     |
| Batch container jobs          | ✅ Kubernetes jobs        | AWS Batch                   |

**📌 Exam Signal:**  
Choose EKS for standard Kubernetes orchestration with AWS-managed control plane; ECS or Lambda for simpler container use cases.

## 📚 Exam Focus

- Choose **Amazon EKS** when:  
  - You need a **fully managed Kubernetes control plane** with automatic upgrades and patching  
  - Your workloads require **Kubernetes worker nodes on EC2 or serverless pods with Fargate**  
  - You want **secure pod networking with VPC CNI and IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**  
  - Integration with **AWS services like ECR, CloudWatch Container Insights, and Load Balancers** is needed  
  - You require **Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines and service mesh (App Mesh)**  

- Avoid EKS if:  
  - You want simple container orchestration without Kubernetes complexity → use ECS  
  - You want lightweight event-driven functions → use Lambda

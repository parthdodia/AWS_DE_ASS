âœ… Amazon EBS â€“ Exam-Oriented Cheat Sheet
âœ… 1. When to Use EBS
Scenario Keywords:

Block storage for EC2

Persistent storage for applications or databases

Needs low-latency storage with high performance

Data must persist after EC2 stop/start

Use Case:
Use EBS when you need block-level storage attached to EC2 instances.

âœ… 2. Volume Types and Performance Mapping
EBS Volume Type	Scenario	Key Metrics	Use Case
gp3 (General Purpose SSD)	Default, cost-effective SSD	3,000 IOPS baseline, up to 16,000 IOPS	Balanced workloads, boot volumes
io2/io2 Block Express	High performance, critical DBs	Up to 256,000 IOPS, 99.999% durability	OLTP, SAP HANA, latency-sensitive
st1 (Throughput HDD)	Large, sequential workloads	500 MB/s throughput	Big data, log processing
sc1 (Cold HDD)	Infrequent access	Low throughput, lowest cost	Archival, cold data
gp2 (legacy)	Replaced by gp3	Scales with size	Boot volumes, general workloads

Exam Signal:
If IOPS, throughput, or cost is emphasized â†’ match volume type accordingly.

âœ… 3. Snapshots (Backups & DR)
Scenario Keywords:

Backup EBS volume

Copy data to another region

Automate backup

Restore volume from backup

Use Case:
Use EBS Snapshots, stored in S3, for point-in-time backup and cross-region disaster recovery.

Exam Tip:

Snapshots are incremental after the first one.

Use Lifecycle Manager to automate snapshot creation.

âœ… 4. Data Durability & Availability
Key Point:
EBS volumes are designed for 99.999% availability and are replicated within the same AZ.

Exam Signal:
If multi-AZ durability is required â†’ EBS is not multi-AZ by default. You must manually replicate snapshots or use EFS/S3 for multi-AZ storage.

âœ… 5. Resizing and Modifying Volumes
Scenario Keywords:

Increase volume size or IOPS

No downtime

Resize without stopping instance

Use Case:
EBS volumes support online resizing (modify volume type, size, IOPS without downtime).

âœ… 6. Encryption
Scenario Keywords:

Encrypt data at rest

Use KMS-managed keys

Compliance requirement

Use Case:
Enable EBS encryption using AWS KMS. This encrypts:

Data at rest

Snapshots

Volumes created from snapshots

âœ… 7. Performance Optimization
Scenario Keywords:

EC2 is slow

High disk latency

Not meeting IOPS

Tips:

Use Provisioned IOPS (io2) for consistent performance

Enable Multi-Attach (io1/io2) to allow multiple EC2 instances to attach same volume (for clustered apps)

Choose the right EBS-optimized EC2 instance type

âœ… 8. Use with Other AWS Services
Auto Scaling Groups â†’ Use launch templates with EBS root volumes

CloudFormation â†’ Automate EBS provisioning

DMS, Backup, or Lambda â†’ Can interact with EBS snapshots programmatically

ðŸ§  Quick EBS Tips for Exam
Feature	Tip
gp3	Best general-purpose SSD (default, customizable throughput and IOPS)
io2	For critical apps needing high durability & IOPS
st1/sc1	For cost-effective, sequential-access workloads
Snapshots	Stored in S3, incremental, support cross-region
Encryption	Use KMS; encrypts data, backups, and volumes
Performance tuning	Resize volumes, switch to io2 for higher IOPS
Durability	Single AZ; replicate manually for multi-AZ needs
Multi-Attach	Only io1/io2 support it (cluster-aware FS)
Auto backup	Use Data Lifecycle Manager

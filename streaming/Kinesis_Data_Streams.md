# üìò Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) ‚Äì Real-Time Data Streaming Service

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a fully managed, scalable service designed to collect and process large streams of real-time data with low latency. It enables building custom applications that analyze or react to streaming data, such as logs, IoT telemetry, clickstreams, and financial transactions.

## ‚úÖ 1. When to Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

**Scenario Keywords:**

- Real-time streaming ingestion  
- High-throughput data pipeline  
- Millisecond latency data processing  
- Partitioned data streams by keys (e.g., user id, device id)  
- Multiple consumers reading from the same stream  
- Require ordered processing within shards  
- Integrate with Lambda for real-time processing  
- Use for custom, complex stream processing logic  
- Need to scale dynamically based on traffic spikes  

**Use Case:**  
Use Kinesis Data Streams when you need to build custom streaming apps that require fine-grained control over processing, replay capability, ordered record consumption, and ability to scale elastically. Good for real-time analytics, metrics ingestion, and complex event processing.

| Component            | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stream**           | The core entity holding data records, composed of multiple shards                             |
| **Shard**            | A fixed throughput unit within a stream (1 MB/sec ingest & 2 MB/sec egress)                   |
| **Record**           | Individual data unit with sequence number, partition key, and data blob                       |
| **Partition Key**    | Key that determines which shard a record is assigned to; controls ordering                   |
| **Sequence Number**  | Unique ID for each record within a shard, used for ordering and checkpointing                |
| **Producers**        | Applications or services that write data records to the stream                               |
| **Consumers**        | Applications/services that read/process data from the stream (e.g., KCL apps, Lambda)         |
| **Enhanced Fan-Out** | Feature enabling dedicated throughput (up to 2 MB/sec per consumer) and independent consumption |
| **Retention Period** | Default 24 hours, extendable up to 7 days for replay and backtracking                        |

| **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** | Automatic delivery of streaming data to S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, etc. |
| **Amazon EMR**              | Batch or streaming analytics on data from Kinesis                    |
| **AWS Glue Streaming**      | Serverless streaming ETL jobs consume Kinesis streams                |
| **Amazon CloudWatch**       | Monitor shard-level metrics, latency, throttling, and record processing |
| **AWS IAM**                 | Access control for producers and consumers                           |

## ‚úÖ 4. Performance & Scaling

- Each shard provides up to 1 MB/sec write and 2 MB/sec read throughput (or up to 1,000 records/sec writes).
- Scale by increasing or decreasing shards via split or merge operations.
- Use Enhanced Fan-Out to allow multiple consumers to read independently without throughput sharing.
- Monitor Iterator Age metric to detect consumer lag and data backlog.
- Use Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time SQL on streaming data integrated with KDS.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Cost Considerations

- Pricing is based on shard hours and PUT payload units (25 KB increments).
- Longer retention periods increase storage cost.
- Enhanced Fan-Out adds per consumer throughput cost.
- Optimize shard count to balance throughput needs and cost efficiency.

## âœ… 4. Performance & Scaling

- Automatically scales to match incoming data volume â€” no manual shard management needed.  
- Buffers data to optimize cost and throughput: default buffering is 5 MB or 300 seconds (configurable).  
- Supports near real-time delivery (latency usually within seconds to a minute).  
- Supports batch writes to destinations, reducing cost and improving throughput.  

---

## âœ… 5. Cost Considerations

- Pay per GB of data ingested and delivered to destinations.  
- Additional charges for optional features like data transformation (Lambda invocations) and format conversion.  
- Cost-effective for heavy, continuous streaming workloads due to batching and compression.

## ðŸ“š Exam Focus

Look out for phrases like **"fully managed data delivery," "automatic loading to AWS destinations," "built-in transformation," "no infrastructure to manage,"** or **"near real-time delivery with buffering."** These signal that **Kinesis Data Firehose** is the right service.

If the question emphasizes **custom processing logic, strict ordering, multiple consumers, replay capabilities,** or **complex stream analytics,** then **Kinesis Data Streams** is usually the better option.

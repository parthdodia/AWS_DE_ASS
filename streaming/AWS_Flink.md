## 📚 Exam Focus 

- Choose **Amazon MSK for Apache Flink** when:
  - You need **exactly-once** stream processing with **low latency**
  - You require **stateful operations**, such as running counts or aggregations
  - The use case involves **windowed processing** on **event time**
  - You want to handle **out-of-order data**
  - The streaming pipeline must scale **automatically** and be **fault-tolerant**

- Avoid MSK for Flink if:
  - The workload is **batch-oriented** → Use **Glue or EMR**
  - You only need simple delivery of raw streams → Use **Kinesis Firehose**
  - You prefer serverless, stateless functions → Use **AWS Lambda**

## ‚úÖ 1. Metrics Collection & Monitoring

- Collects metrics from AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda, RDS, EKS) and custom metrics  
- Supports standard (1-minute) and high-resolution (up to 1-second) metrics  
- Enables alarms to trigger notifications or automated actions based on metric thresholds  

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
If scenario involves **monitoring resource health**, setting **alarms**, or **auto-triggering actions**, use **CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms**

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Logs Management

- Centralized collection of logs from EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and custom sources  
- Supports **CloudWatch Logs Insights** for querying and analyzing log data  
- Retention policies and log group management for cost control  

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
If you need to **collect, store, analyze logs**, or **debug applications**, CloudWatch Logs is the answer

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Dashboards & Visualization

- Create custom dashboards to visualize metrics and logs  
- Supports widgets like line graphs, stacked area, numbers, and text  
- Share dashboards with teams  

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
If scenario calls for **centralized visual monitoring** and **reporting**, use **CloudWatch Dashboards**

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Events & Automated Actions (EventBridge Integration)

- CloudWatch Events (now part of EventBridge) enables event-driven automation  
- Respond to resource state changes, schedule cron jobs, or trigger Lambda functions  
- Supports rules that filter and route events to targets  

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
If automation based on **AWS resource changes** or **scheduled events** is needed ‚Üí use **CloudWatch Events/EventBridge**

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Application Insights & Anomaly Detection

- CloudWatch Application Insights automatically detects issues in applications  
- Anomaly Detection uses machine learning to identify unusual metric behavior  

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
For **proactive monitoring** and **anomaly detection**, these features help reduce manual troubleshooting

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Integration & Security

- Works with CloudTrail for auditing API calls  
- Logs and metrics data can be exported to S3 or third-party tools  
- Supports IAM permissions for fine-grained access control  

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
Look for **auditing** or **compliance monitoring** scenarios ‚Üí CloudWatch + CloudTrail combo

# ðŸ“˜ Amazon EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge is a **serverless event bus service** that makes it easy to connect applications using data from your own apps, integrated SaaS apps, and AWS services with near real-time event routing and processing.

---

## âœ… 1. Event-Driven Architecture & Serverless Integration

- Enables building **loosely coupled, event-driven applications**  
- Routes events from **AWS services, SaaS partners, or custom apps** to targets like Lambda, Step Functions, SNS, SQS, Kinesis, and more  
- Supports **schema discovery and registry** for event validation and code generation  

ðŸ“Œ **Exam Signal:**  
If a question involves **event routing without managing infrastructure** or **integrating SaaS with AWS apps via events**, EventBridge is the answer.

---

## âœ… 2. Event Sources & Targets

- Supports **native AWS services** as event sources (CloudTrail, EC2, S3, CodePipeline, etc.)  
- Integrates with **SaaS providers** (Zendesk, PagerDuty, Datadog, etc.) as event sources  
- Targets include **AWS Lambda, Step Functions, Kinesis streams, SQS queues, SNS topics, and more**  

ðŸ“Œ **Exam Signal:**  
If a scenario involves **event ingestion from SaaS or AWS services routed to serverless or stream processing**, EventBridge fits perfectly.

---

## âœ… 3. Event Filtering & Routing Rules

- Define **event patterns** to filter and route events selectively  
- Supports **content-based filtering** on event payloads  
- Routes events to **multiple targets** based on rules  
- Supports **dead-letter queues (DLQs)** for failed event deliveries  

ðŸ“Œ **Exam Signal:**  
Look for questions on **routing specific events based on content or multiple targets**, EventBridge rules handle this efficiently.

---

## âœ… 4. Schema Registry & Discovery

- Automatically discovers event schemas from event streams  
- Allows storing and versioning schemas in a **central schema registry**  
- Enables **code generation** for typed event bindings in popular programming languages  

ðŸ“Œ **Exam Signal:**  
If the question emphasizes **schema validation or generating code from event schemas**, EventBridge Schema Registry is the feature.

---

## âœ… 5. Reliability & Scalability

- Fully managed, **highly available and scalable** event bus  
- Supports **at-least-once delivery semantics**  
- Event archiving and replay capabilities for auditing and recovery  
- Event size up to 256 KB, supports batching to increase throughput  

ðŸ“Œ **Exam Signal:**  
If high availability, durability, or event replay is part of the scenario, EventBridge supports all these.

---

## âœ… 6. Security & Access Control

- Uses **IAM policies** to control event bus and rule permissions  
- Supports **resource-based policies** on event buses  
- Integrates with **AWS KMS** for encryption at rest  
- Events encrypted in transit via TLS  

ðŸ“Œ **Exam Signal:**  
Questions on securing event routing and controlling who can publish or consume events point to EventBridgeâ€™s IAM and encryption features.

## âœ… 7. Use Cases

| Use Case                | Explanation                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application integration | Connect decoupled microservices via events                    |
| SaaS integration        | Ingest SaaS events (e.g., Zendesk tickets) into AWS workflows |
| Automated workflows     | Trigger Lambda or Step Functions based on events              |
| Auditing & compliance   | Archive and replay events for audit trails                    |
| Real-time monitoring    | Route system and app events to monitoring tools               |

ðŸ“Œ **Exam Signal:**  
If the scenario involves **event-driven orchestration, SaaS-AWS integration, or event replay**, EventBridge is ideal.

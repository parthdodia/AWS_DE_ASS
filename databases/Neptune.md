# üìò Amazon Neptune ‚Äì Fully Managed Graph Database Service

**Amazon Neptune** is a purpose-built, fully managed graph database service designed for **highly connected data** and **complex graph queries**. It supports two graph models and their native query languages.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Use Case: Graph Database for Relationships & Connections

- Ideal for applications like **social networks, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, recommendation engines**
- Optimized for **graph traversals and relationship queries** inefficient in relational DBs
- Handles **millions of queries per second** with low latency

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
Choose Neptune if scenario involves:
- Complex relationships or connected data
- Graph traversals or relationship-heavy queries

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Supported Graph Models & Query Languages

| Graph Model   | Query Language          | Description                      |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Property Graph| Apache TinkerPop Gremlin| Traversal-based, imperative style|
| RDF Graph     | SPARQL                 | Semantic web, declarative querying|

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
Mention of **Gremlin** or **SPARQL** ‚Üí Neptune.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Fully Managed & Highly Available

- Automatic hardware provisioning, patching, backups, failover
- **Multi-AZ deployment** with **automatic failover**
- Data replicated **six ways across three AZs** for durability

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
If scenario stresses multi-AZ HA and durability in graph DB ‚Üí Neptune.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Security & Access Control

- Runs inside **VPC** with security groups
- Supports **IAM database authentication** (especially for SPARQL endpoints)
- Encryption at rest via **AWS KMS**
- Encryption in transit with **TLS**
- Fine-grained access control via IAM and network policies

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
Secure graph DB with VPC isolation + encryption = Neptune.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Integration & Ecosystem

- Integrates with **AWS Lambda**, **CloudWatch**, **AWS Glue**, and **SageMaker**
- Supports **data import/export** in CSV, RDF, and Gremlin formats
- Provides CloudWatch metrics and logs for monitoring

üìå **Exam Signal:**  
Graph analytics + serverless or ML workflows ‚Üí Neptune.

## ‚úÖ 6. Comparison: Neptune vs DynamoDB vs DocumentDB

| Feature          | Neptune                           | DynamoDB                   | DocumentDB (MongoDB API)  |
|------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Data Model       | Graph (Property + RDF)           | Key-Value / Document       | Document (JSON-like)      |
| Query Language   | Gremlin, SPARQL                  | PartiQL, SDK               | MongoDB Query API         |
| Use Case         | Connected data, relationships   | General-purpose NoSQL      | JSON document store       |
| High Availability| Multi-AZ synchronous replication | Multi-region Global Tables | Multi-AZ replicas         |
| Managed Service  | ‚úÖ                              | ‚úÖ                         | ‚úÖ                        |
